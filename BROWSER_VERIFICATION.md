# 🌐 Browser Verification Status

## Current Status: DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS

### Browser Check Results:

**URL Tested:** https://complens-88a4f.web.app

**Current Status:** ❌ "Site Not Found"
- This confirms the app has NOT been deployed yet
- The deployment process is currently running

### What's Happening:

1. ✅ **Build Process**: Running in background
2. ⏳ **Deployment**: Will start after build completes
3. ⏳ **Verification**: Will re-check in browser after deployment

### Expected Timeline:

- **Build**: 2-3 minutes (in progress)
- **Deploy**: 1-2 minutes (pending)
- **Total**: 3-5 minutes

### After Deployment Completes:

The browser will show:
- ✅ Your app (not "Site Not Found")
- ✅ Login page at `/auth`
- ✅ All features working

### Next Verification:

I will automatically:
1. Wait for build/deploy to complete
2. Navigate to https://complens-88a4f.web.app
3. Verify the app loads correctly
4. Test that it's not showing "Site Not Found"
