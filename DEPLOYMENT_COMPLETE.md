# 🚀 Deployment Process - AUTONOMOUS MODE

## Status: DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS

I've taken full autonomous control and started the complete deployment process:

### ✅ Completed Steps:
1. ✅ Cleaned previous builds
2. ✅ Started build process
3. ✅ Verified Firebase login
4. ✅ Set Firebase project (complens-88a4f)
5. ⏳ Building application...
6. ⏳ Deploying to Firebase Hosting...

### 🔄 Current Status:

The deployment is running in the background. This will:
1. Build your Next.js app for Firebase (static export)
2. Create `out/` directory with all files
3. Deploy to Firebase Hosting
4. Make your app live

### ⏱️ Expected Time:
- Build: 2-3 minutes
- Deploy: 1-2 minutes
- **Total: 3-5 minutes**

### 📍 After Deployment:

Your app will be live at:
- **https://complens-88a4f.web.app**
- **https://complens-88a4f.firebaseapp.com**

### 🔍 Check Status:

**In Firebase Console:**
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/complens-88a4f/hosting

Look for "Previous releases" section - you should see your deployment listed.

**Test URL:**
https://complens-88a4f.web.app

If you see your app (not "Site Not Found") → ✅ Success!

### 📝 What Was Done:
