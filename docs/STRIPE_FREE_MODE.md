# How to Keep Stripe 100% Free

## ✅ Stripe Test Mode is Already Free!

**Good news:** Stripe Test Mode costs **$0.00** - forever. No charges, no credit card needed.

## What You Need to Do

### 1. In Stripe Setup Screen

When you see the "How do you want to start?" screen:

1. **Select "Recurring payments"** ✅
   - This is what we need for subscriptions
   - Click the checkbox next to "Recurring payments"
   
2. **Click "Continue"** (or "Skip for now" - you can always add features later)

### 2. You're Done!

That's it! Stripe Test Mode is:
- ✅ **100% free** - no charges ever

## How It Works

### Test Mode (Free Forever)
